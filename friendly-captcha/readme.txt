Friendly Captcha is a privacy-first anti-bot solution that protects WordPress website forms from spam and abuse.

== Description ==
 
Friendly Captcha is a privacy-first anti-bot solution that protects WordPress website forms from spam and abuse. 

Do you use a captcha like reCAPTCHA to keep out bots? Friendly Captcha is a powerful anti-spam service that blocks spam-bots without annoying captcha images and protects user privacy. 

== How Friendly Captcha Works ==

Friendly Captcha is a tool for preventing spam on your website. Other CAPTCHAs are a burden on your users, Friendly Captcha respects your users. 

Friendly Captcha is a proof-of-work based anti-bot solution in which the user's device does all the work. We generate a unique crypto puzzle for each visitor.

Solving it will usually take only a few seconds. As soon as the user starts filling the form it starts getting solved. By the time the user is ready to submit, the puzzle is probably already solved.

Friendly Captcha prevents spam and doesn't punish real users in doing so.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the Friendly Captcha plugin? =

The Friendly Captcha plugin supports WordPress core and many plugins with forms automatically. 

To use Friendly Captcha, you can create an account at [www.friendlycaptcha.com](https://friendlycaptcha.com/) and create a Site Key and API Key there. It is best to copy both keys and save them in a safe place. Then go to the Friendly Captcha plugin settings page and enter the created site key and API key. Below that, select the forms you want to protect. Finally, save these settings by clicking on the "Save Changes" button at the end of the settings page.

= You don't support a certain plugin. How can I get support for it added? =
Open a PR on GitHub [here](https://github.com/FriendlyCaptcha/friendly-captcha-wordpress) or just email the authors of the plugin itself. Adding Friendly Captcha support is typically quite a quick task for most plugins.
